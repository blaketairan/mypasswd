用来存储自己的密码
方式：
    AES-265加密，密码自己记，加密后的数据随时同步至github
用法：
	请安装python3 使用pip安装dependency.list中依赖
    fork本项目 运行setup.py初始化（添加软链） 然后执行mypd命令 具体见mypd -h
    通过config可以调整一些配置

What's this?
	To help you remember your passwd
How it works?
	In brief, the cryptographic secret file include you account&passwd info which encrypted with the password you give by AES-256, and could synchronize through github.
Usage:
	First, fork this project.
	Pls use Python3 to run this projcet.(Didn't test with python2!) You may use pip3 tu install the module in the file named dependency.
	Run setup.sh to create a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin/mypd
	Then try mypd -h to get the usage with mypd.

TODO:
	Doc - README:some example & add more code-commenting 
	Funciton - chrome plugin to support autocomplete on web page.
	Encryption - Learn more to find if there is any safer way.
	User experience - maybe, easier to use
